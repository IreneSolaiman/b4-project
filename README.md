This is where we will build some of our project 

#Types of Cyber Attacks : Irene
file | description
-----|------------
[Data Source](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2017/) | Visualization data from Verizon's 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, a downloadable PDF
[Sunburst](https://bl.ocks.org/vasturiano/12da9071095fbd4df434e60d52d2d58d) | Visualization
[Data in JSON](charts/sunburst.json) | Reformatted for use in D3
[Types of Attacks](https://irenesolaiman.github.io/b4-project/types.html) | Project webpage

This is terrible hygiene, but I created a folder called "chart-practice" with the visualization's original data, and first made sure it would run on my local server. I then manually inserted the data from the PDF one by one (I could not figure out how to extract data from a PDF, especially when the data is provided in different formats, like bar graphs and tables). I kept running by trial and error until I had a sunburst I wanted working on my local server, then transported it to my b4-project folder and pushed it to GitHub.

#Breaches : Irene

[Data Source](http://breachlevelindex.com/) | Visualization data from breachlevelindex
[Donut](hhttps://bl.ocks.org/mbhall88/b2504f8f3e384de4ff2b9dfa60f325e2) | Visualization
[Data in CSV](charts/donut.csv) | Reformatted for use in D3
[Breaches](https://irenesolaiman.github.io/b4-project/breaches.html) | Project webpage

I managed to somehow 'scrape' the website using Inspect Element and pull the data for breaches by sector from 2013 to 2017. I put this in an Excel document and converted it to CSV. This is also terrible hygiene, but I used the folder called "chart-practice" with the donut visualization's original data, and first made sure it would run on my local server. I then manually inserted the data from my created CSV into the visualization's CSV one by one (I was afraid because it kept breaking when I used my own CSV). I kept running by trial and error until I had a donut I wanted working on my local server, then transported it to my b4-project folder and pushed it to GitHub.
