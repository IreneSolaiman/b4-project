<p> The rapid growth of internet technology has dramatically transformed our lives. However, this has also led to a proliferation of security risks. Our general awareness of cybersecurity threats and our ability to formulate comprehensive policies to tackle these risks continue lag behind, and the gap continues to grow.

This website analyses some of the existing data in the cyberspace arena and takes a look at the following issues:</p>
<ul> 
	<li> Key industries facing cyber attacks and risks </li>
	<li> Correlation between the internet penetration rate of nations and their cyber security readiness </li>
	<li> Improvements made to the cyber security readiness of various nations over the years </li>
</ul>
