<p> The tremendous growth of internet technology over the past few decades has dramatically transformed our lives. However, this has also led to a proliferation of security risks. Our general awareness of cybersecurity threats and our ability to formulate comprehensive policies to tackle these risks continue to lag behind the rapid innovations in cyberspace capabilities.

This website analyses some of the existing data in the cyberspace arena and takes a look at the following issues:</p>
<ul> 
	<li> The most common forms of cyber attacks and the key industries these risks </li>
	<li> Improvements made to the cybersecurity readiness of various nations over the years </li>
	<li> Correlation between the internet penetration rate of nations and their cybersecurity readiness </li>
</ul>
