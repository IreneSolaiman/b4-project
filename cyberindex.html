	<h1>Cybersecurity Index vs Internet Penetration Rate (2015)</h1>
	<h2>How many countries are well-prepared for the cybersecurity risks that we face today?</h2>

	<div id="world"></div>	


			<div><p>The chart above shows the correlation between the Cybersecurity Index and the Internet Penetration Rate (as a percentage of overall population) for 185 countries, as of 2015. The Cybersecurity Index, on a scale of 0 to 1, was developed by the International Telecommunications Union, a specialized agency under the United Nations. The Internet Penetration Rate was compiled by the World Bank.</p>

			<p>Not surprisingly, a large number of countries fall into the bottom left quadrant of the chart. Countries with low internet penetration rates generally have low cybersecurity indices, as the issue of cybersecurity would be of lower priority to them. Similarly, we would expect many countries to fall into the top right quadrant of the chart, as countries with higher internet penetration rates would have a greater incentive to improve their cyber defenses.</p></div>

			<h3>Europe and Central Asia</h3>

				<div><p>What is more surprising is that a significant number of countries fall into the bottom right quadrant of the chart. This is of great concern as these countries have high internet penetration rates but have not done enough to defend their cyberspace. From the chart, it appears that many of them come from Europe and Central Asia. </p>

				<div id="europe"></div>	

				<p>8 countries in Europe and Central Asia have an internet penetration rate of more than 70% but score lower than 0.3 in the Cybersecurity Index. These countries are Andorra, Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, Kazahkstan, Liechtenstein, Macedonia and Slovenia.</p></div>

				<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa</h3>

				<div><p>Another interesting quadrant lies in the top left of the chart. These are countries that have healthy cybersecurity indices even though they have a relatively low internet penetration rate. Of note, although most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are in the bottom left quadrant, there are also a few in the top left quadrant with healthy cybersecurity indices.</p></div>

				<div id="africa"></div>

				<div><p>There are two countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with less than 50% internet penetration rates, but score more than 0.5 on the Cybersecurity Index. These two countries are Rwanda and Uganda.</p></div>
