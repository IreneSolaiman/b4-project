	<h1>Cybersecurity Index vs Internet Penetration (2015)</h1>
	<h2>How many countries are well-prepared for the cybersecurity risks that we face today?</h2>

		<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		<script src="charts/cyberindex.js"></script></div>	

			<div><p>The chart above shows the correlation between the Cybersecurity Index and the Internet Penetration Rate (as a percentage of overall population) for 185 countries, as of 2015. (The Cybersecurity Index, on a scale of 0 to 1, was developed by the International Telecommunications Union, a specialized agency under the United Nations. The Internet Penetration Rate was compiled by the World Bank.)</p>

			<p>It is no surprise that a large number of countries fall into the bottom left corner of the chart, i.e. countries with low internet penetration rates generally do not have low cybersecurity indices, since the issue of cybersecurity would be of lower priority to these countries. By the same token, we would expect a large number of countries to fall into the top right corner of the chart, i.e. countries with higher internet penetration rates score higher on the cybersecurity index.</p>

			<p>What is more surprising is that a significant number of countries fall into the bottom right corner of the chart. This is of great concern as these countries have high internet penetration rates but have not done enough to safeguard their cyberspace. From the chart, it is clear that many of these countries come from Europe and Central Asia. Let's take a closer look at this region.</p></div>

				<div><p>Worryingly, 8 countries in Europe and Central Asia have an internet penetration rate of more than 70% but score lower than 0.3 in the Cybersecurity Index. These countries are Andorra, Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, Kazahkstan, Liechtenstein, Macedonia and Slovenia.</p></div>
